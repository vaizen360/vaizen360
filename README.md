Hi, Iâ€™m @vaizen360
- Iâ€™m interested in genome engineering, cell therapies, and protein design and am excited about using powerful bioinformatics and computational tools to advance this research.
  I graduated with my Masters of Science in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology from the University of California, Santa Barbara in December 2023, where I studied
  double strand break repair in relation to the cell cycle in mammalian cell culture in Dr. Chris Richardson's lab. During this research, I also collaborated with other lab
  members to develop a rudimentary ChIP (Chromatin Immuno Precipitation) sequence data analysis pipeline for stranded data. I wrote this pipeline using snakemake, and it is
  available here under the repository SnakeSeq.

  Previously I completed my Bachelors of Science degree in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology at the University of Washington, Seattle in March 2020. During this time
  I worked as an Undergraduate Research Associate in Dr. Daniel Promislow's lab studying the systems biology of age associated diseases - in my case mitochondrial diseases such as
  Leigh's syndrome associated with mutations in the mitochondrial gene ND2. To do so, I conducted Genome Wide Association studies of data collected from Drosophila with varying
  genetic backgrounds to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with ameliorating or exacerbating the effects of this mitochondrial mutation. As such, I had
  to prepare and process large datasets prior to conducting GWAS and statistical analyses to identify these SNPs. My workflow for analyzing this data is available here in the
  repository spinFly. 

- Iâ€™m currently trying to learn more about ML for protein and gRNA design, as well as how to write pipelines to automate basic biological data analyses
